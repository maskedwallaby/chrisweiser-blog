I'm a front-end visual developer who specializing in UI/UX. I design web and app interfaces and specialize in accessibility. I also code and implement custom WordPress website templates for clients.

I graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design from Iowa State University in 2009. Previously I interned at the Iowa Energy Center and worked for QA Graphics in Ankeny, Iowa. I'm a native of the town I'm living in, but I also like to hit the road and get comfortable in airports.

While studying at Iowa State, I received several awards from the Art Directors Association of Iowa. I also mentored in the Graphic Design Student Association and studied abroad in Rome, Italy in 2008.

In my free time, I like to bike, draw, play D&D, and try out new web tools.
